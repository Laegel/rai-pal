            This is a loader plugin for BepInEx5.
            When referencing RuntimeUnityEditor from other code it's recommended to not reference this assembly and instead reference RuntimeUnityEditorCore directly.
            If you need your code to run after RUE is initialized, add a <code>[BepInDependency(RuntimeUnityEditorCore.GUID)]</code> attribute to your plugin.
            You can see if RuntimeUnityEditor has finished loading with <code>RuntimeUnityEditorCore.IsInitialized()</code>.
