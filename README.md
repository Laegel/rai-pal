This is a thing to help find games of a specific engine, and then easily install universal mods for that game. I made it because when I'm making mods for games, there's a few different steps that are repeated for every game:

- Checking the game engine.
- Checking the engine version.
- Checking the Unity scripting backend (il2cpp/mono).
- Installing Unity Explorer for inspecting the game scenes.
- etc

So this tool automates a lot of that work. This also lets you filter your Steam owned games by engine, so you can for instance find all the Unreal games you own.
