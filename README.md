This is a thing to help find games of a specific engine, and then easily install universal mods for that game. I made it because when I'm making mods for games, there's a few different steps that are repeated for every game:

- Checking the game engine.
- Checking the engine version.
- Checking the Unity scripting backend (il2cpp/mono).
- Installing Unity Explorer for inspecting the game scenes.
- etc

So this tool automates a lot of that work. This also lets you filter your Steam owned games by engine, so you can for instance find all the Unreal games you own.

## UEVR

Rai Pal can make it easier to use [Praydog's UEVR](https://uevr.io/), a universal VR mod for Unreal Engine games. Here are some of the fun activities Rai Pal can help you with:
- Find all the Unreal Engine games in your Steam library (even the ones you haven't installed yet).
- Detect the Unreal Engine version of games you have installed.
- Download and auto-update UEVR (once it's publicly released).
- Launch UEVR for a specific game, so you don't need to select the game process in the UEVR menu.
- If you already have access to a private release of UEVR, you can just manually drop the UEVR files in Rai Pal's mod folder to be able to use these features.
