[**Download Rai Pal**](https://github.com/Raicuparta/rai-pal/releases/latest)

This is a thing to help find games of a specific engine, and then easily install universal mods for that game. I made it because when I'm making mods for games, there's a few different steps that are repeated for every game:

- Checking the game engine.
- Checking the engine version.
- Checking the Unity scripting backend (il2cpp/mono).
- Installing Unity Explorer for inspecting the game scenes.
- etc

So this tool automates a lot of that work. This also lets you filter your Steam owned games by engine, so you can for instance find all the Unreal games you own.

## Automatically finding games

Rai Pal analyzes files on your system to determine which games you own, and which games you have currently installed. There's some guesswork involved in this, especially since Rai Pal tries to give you this information as quickly as possible, without the need to log in with each provider's account. Here is the current status of how Rai Pal handles finding games from each provider:

| Provider | Installed | Owned | Engine detection for owned games | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Recreating Steam cache helps.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| GOG      | ‚úÖ        | ‚úÖ    | üëçGood                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Epic     | ‚úÖ        | ‚úÖ    | ü§èApproximate                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

There are [scripts](https://gist.github.com/lats/c920866caf9c0cb04e82abba411e1bb9) for adding all games from a bundle to your library, but they're slow and not recommended by the Itch team. |
| PC Xbox  | ‚úÖ\*      | ‚ùå    | üëéNone                           | Only finds installed games marked as moddable (the ones where you can open the game files folder via the Xbox app)                                                                                                                                                      |

For all other providers, you'll have to manually add the games to Rai Pal using the "add game" button on the installed games tab, or by just dropping the game exe on the Rai Pal window.

## UEVR

Rai Pal can make it easier to use [Praydog's UEVR](https://uevr.io/), a universal VR mod for Unreal Engine games. Here are some of the fun activities Rai Pal can help you with:

- Find all the Unreal Engine games in your Steam library (even the ones you haven't installed yet).
- Automatically find installed Unreal Engine games (supports Steam, GOG, and Epic, more to come later).
- Detect the Unreal Engine version of games you have installed.
- Show the UEVR compatibility score for installed Steam games (hidden by default, check the filters menu).
- Download and auto-update UEVR.
- Launch UEVR for a specific game, so you don't need to select the game process in the UEVR menu.
